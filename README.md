<h1>HDHomeRun Live</h1>

This is an attempt to serve live TV from older HDHomeRun units in a simple IPTV
compatible format.

This is a node.js server that can be run on a linux machine with the
hdhomerun_config utility.  That's the plan, anyway -- nothing actually works
yet.

<h2>Installation</h2>
Coming soon.
